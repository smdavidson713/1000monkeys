# C1/H1 Simulate 1000 Monkeys With Typewriters Writing Shakespeare

We are going to write a genetic algorithm that simulates 1000 (or so) monkeys with 
typewriters writing shakespeare. Some of this will be done in class; some of this
will be done as homework. You'll be working with this repository for both. Once 
you create your instance of this repository, the instructor can't edit the readmes
for everyone in the class in one move. As such, in-class parts of the assignments 
will be announced in class. Homework parts of the assignment will be announced in
class and with a followup post on piazza.
